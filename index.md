# Synopsis
In today's remote-centric work environment, teams often need to compose emails to their superiors or clients as a group, but they have no easy way to do so. While real-time document and code editing solutions exist, there is no such real-time email collaboration software. Our team is working on designing software that will allow groups of people from the same organization to compose emails real-time and collaboratively, increasing group cohesion and delivering better quality results to their superiors or clients.
# Video
We made a video detailing what this solution would entail and what features it would have.
